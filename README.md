- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DrWoodhouse
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a mathematician moving into the tech industry after a phd at McGill and postdocs at the Technion and The University of Oxford.
     Currently I'm interested in learning about cyber security, cryptography, and artificial intelligence.
     My academic interests lay in a field called geometric group theory, which meant I was a geometer who studied symmetry.
     Previously I contributed code to the FLINT number theory library (written in C) as a summer project as an undergraduate.
     
     You can reach me here, on twitter, or via my academic webpage (www.djwoodhouse.com)
